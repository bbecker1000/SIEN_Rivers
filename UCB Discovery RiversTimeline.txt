Week	Monday date	Overview	
1	2/7/2022	Introduction	
Weekly Milestones: "Kickoff meeting, read background material"

2	2/14/2022	github/individual orientation to project and data/start EDA	
Weekly Milestones: 
i)EDA w/ datamaid and any other EDA products; 
ii) github set-up; 
iii)individual project

3	2/21/2022	EDA on hydro data sets/start with code	
Weekly Milestones:
-set-up github project - Ben will set up project. Brandon and Noor will take it from there. 
-Create project tracking Readme file -  andi 
-Query current datasets and upload to github - andi (note -looking like i will get them uploaded tomorrow morning)
-Test Matlab/R conversion package - Brandon 
-EDA w/ current datasets - Noor

4	2/28/2022	convert and test code
Weekly Milestones:
-Determine best way to convert - test conversion package more and determine if best approach or just rewrite 
-Data import figured out for both Ned's test file and the two current datasets 
-have two of the .m files done at minimum -- up and running. 
 	
5	3/7/2022	convert and test code 	
- Convert the remainder of the code - done
- Test/compare against MatLab runs - in progress
- Look for existing compare files package or creeate your own
- Clean up the R code and document
- Andi - check results to date against Ned's prior work
- Andi - develop workflow 
- Andi - change meeting time to 11:15


6	3/14/2022	put into one document with simple workflow	Create Markdown doc w/ workflow
- Cont. comparing Matlab and R code
- clean, improve, and docuemnt R code
- pull in and clean-up the two USGS datasets
- Start graphing for following metrics: mean daily discharge, mean annual discharge, annual total discharge (rows 4-6 on RiverMetrics_Programs.xlsx)
- Document input columns from USGS datasets - andi
- Document output columns based on Ned's code - andi


6	3/29/2022	
- Cont. comparing Matlab and R code
- clean, improve, and docuemnt R code
- pull in and clean-up the two USGS datasets (done in excel to date - transfer workflow to R)
- Complete graphs for following metrics: mean daily discharge, mean annual discharge, annual total discharge (rows 4-6 on RiverMetrics_Programs.xlsx)
- Start the remainder of the graphs - get as far you can with remainder, include 3D plot
- Document input columns from USGS datasets - andi
- Document output columns based on Ned's code - andi


7	3/21/2022	qaqc	
8	3/28/2022	improve on workflow and initial test with data sets	
9	4/4/2022	improve on code and workflow/qaqc	
10	4/11/2022	additional coding for any missing metrics or additoinal features we want to add	
11	4/18/2022	Complete draft markdown report	
12	4/25/2022	Prepare presentation & revise report	
13	5/2/2022	Submit final report and give presentation to NPS. Prepare Discovery Program showcase (blog or presentation)	
			
6	4/5/2022	
- Cont. comparing Matlab and R code - only remaining is additional qa/qc on the leap year issue; otherwise done
- clean, improve, and docuemnt R code - in progress
- pull in and clean-up the two USGS datasets (done in excel to date - transfer workflow to R)
- Complete graphs for following metrics:  mean annual discharge (boxplots), annual total discharge, plus rows 7 and 8
- Send Andi crosswalk of Ned's code and output for headers
- Document input columns from USGS datasets - andi
- Document output columns based on Ned's code - andi
			
	
	4/19/2022
	- Presentation outline 
	- Date for presentation - Noor and Brandon send Andi date ranges; Andi schedule with NPS
	- Cross check updated USGS R code with Matlab code output (Brandon)
	- Get .rmd file running (Brandon)
	- Noor - graphs (Ben will help with 3D plot)
			
	May 6  showcase date
